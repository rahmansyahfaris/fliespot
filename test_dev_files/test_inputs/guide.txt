PARAMETERS:

title:first command,x:0,y:0,z:0,velocity:0.2,yaw:0,rate:45,hold:1,note:this is the first command

EXPLANATION:

<title>
title of the command to give some documentation or context
can contain spaces and tabs but of course not line breaks (because the lines indicate the individual commands)
title can be useful for marking in logging, observing, and monitoring purposes as it can be set to print in the console

<x>
target distance of moving forward (positive) or backward (negative)
default value is 0
in meters

<y>
target distance of moving left (positive) or right (negative)
default value is 0
in meters

<z>
this is suppose to be the target distance of moving up (positive) or down (negative)
in meters
this parameter is not tested because the project does not dwell on changing altitudes
it is not conventional to include this parameter unless you know what you are doing
this parameter exists simply for further development, it is not yet developed, it doesn't even work
if you want to change drone's flight height/altitude, change the DEFAULT_HEIGHT instead of using this parameter

<velocity>
velocity of the drone's movement
default value is default_velocity
in meters per second (supposedly but we concluded that it seems to be not accurately)

<yaw>
target angle of rotating/turning counter-clockwise/left (positive) or clockwise/right (negative)
default value is 0
in degrees

<rate>
angular velocity of the drone when rotating to target yaw
default value is default_yaw_rate
in degrees per second

<hold>
amount of time to pause before proceeding to the next command after finishing the current command
default value is default_hold_time
in seconds
we concluded that the value must be at least 1 second to give the drone time to adjust
you can use 0 seconds but the next command should only be just a hold and with a value of at least 1 second (for marking purposes)

<note>
note of the command to give some documentation or context
can contain spaces and tabs but of course not line breaks (because the lines indicate the individual commands)

please note that these conditions must be met or flight will not happen and will throw exception
x, y, and z must be 0 and rate must be greater than 0 if you want to use yaw
yaw must be 0 and velocity must be greater than 0 if you want to use x, y, and z
